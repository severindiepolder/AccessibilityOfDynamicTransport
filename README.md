# Accessibility Of Dynamic Transport

# Further Documentation will be added!

## Relates Research

The presented tool was developed during the 6 month research internship of Severin Diepolder at <a href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/en" target="_blank">Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP)</a>. 
The Methodology and Implementation is described in detail the resulting thesis written for the study program M.Sc. Transportation Systems at <a href="https://www.tum.de" target="_blank">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>.

The research topic summerizes to:

Social inequality within urban areas is reinforced by the unequal availability of public trans- port. Areas with high population density like city centres are served with high frequency and capacity public transport, while lower density areas are lacking such quality of service, as improvement of services is deemed uneconomic. Novel dynamic public transport modes are designed to serve large, low-density areas adapting to the demand by no longer rely- ing on a fixed network or schedule. This can make these systems profitable as feeder lines for conventional public transport lines. The impact of these expansions can be measured in changes in accessibility, but presently no tool exists to quantify accessibility based on sim- ulation or real-world data for intermodal trips with dynamic and line-based public transport modes. This research develops an approach to deal with the scarce and scattered data by spatio-temporal modelling performance indicators of dynamic services and converting them into a graph-based representation. This graph is used as input for the established tool City- Chrone to quantify accessibility. By comparing the status quo and scenarios with integrated dynamic transport, an improvement in public transport connectivity for low-density areas can be observed, providing a proof of concept for the novel approach.
